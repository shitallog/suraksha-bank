                Account to be same). The Bank reserves its rights to consider any deviation to the above at it sole
                discretion. The Demat Account will be attached to the Cust id and will be accessible through NetBanking.
                Wherever the Demat Account is jointly held by the Customer, the Bank will construe that the other
                holders of the Demat Account have authorized the first holder to either query on the account or initiate
                transaction on the account and it will be binding on them.<br><br>

                Due to the fact that the Bank receives Demat Information from NSDL and CDSL , it is important to check
                the current position with your respective branch.<br>

                8.14 NETBANKING ACCESS:<br>

                I understand that the Bank would allot me a Cust id and IPIN in the first instance.<br><br>

                I will be required to change the IPIN assigned by the Bank on accessing NetBanking for the first time
                and thereafter at certain intervals. As a safety measure, the Bank may ask me to change my IPIN on a
                compulsory basis.<br><br>

                I agree that in the absence of any specific request from me for personally collecting the IPIN, the IPIN

                Authentication like Public or Private Keys / Risk Engine / Challenge Questions.<br><br>

                the computers of the Bank through any means other than the NetBanking Service.<br><br>

                I am aware that the transaction through NetBanking can be effected by concurrent use of Cust id and
                IPIN.<br><br>

                8.15 IPIN :<br><br>

                I understand and agree that I must:<br><br>

                Keep the IPIN totally confidential and not reveal the IPIN to any third party.<br><br>

                Choose an IPIN which shall be at least of 6 characters long or such minimum number as may be specified
                by the Bank from time to time and shall consist of a mix of alphabets, numbers and special characters
                which must not relate to any readily accessible personal data such as my name, address, telephone
                number, driver license etc. or easily guessable combination of letters and number;<br><br>

                Commit the IPIN to memory and not record them in a written or electronic form;<br><br>

                I agree that in case I forget the IPIN, I can request for change of the IPIN. Such replacement shall not

                8.16 CHARGES:<br>

                I authorize the Bank to recover all charges related to Net Banking as determined by the Bank from time

                8.17 MAILING ADDRESS:<br>

                until some processing work or Maintenance activity is being done. In case the services are not available

                I shall not hold the Bank responsible for not processing/effecting any transactions in case the Bank
                does not receive instruction to this effect even though I have forwarded the same electronically, i.e.
                by means of e-mails and short messaging services (SMS). In the event of any dispute on the actual
                communication made to the Bank , the records of the Bank shall be final and binding on me .<br><br>

                I hereby agree to abide by the following Terms and Conditions in addition to the Terms and Conditions as
                applicable to NetBanking:<br><br>

                I shall be at liberty to utilise the Payment Instruction Services through Net Banking for transfer of
                funds for such purpose, as I shall deem fit;<br>

                I have the full right and/or authority to access and avail of the services obtained and the goods
                purchased and I shall observe and comply with the applicable laws and regulations in each jurisdiction
                in applicable territories. I shall not involve the Bank as a party to such transaction. I shall provide
                the Bank with such information and/or assistance as is required by the Bank for the performance of the
                Services and/or any other obligations of the Bank herein.<br><br>

                I shall not at any time provide to any person, with any of my details held by me with the Bank,
                including Customer ID, IPIN, account number, Card details, PIN/TIM m-PIN which may be assigned to me by
                the Bank from time to time.<br><br>

                I agree that the Bank shall be entitled to presume that all instructions received by the Bank by using
                my Cust id and IPIN are in order / genuine and have been actually given by me and I shall be bound by
                the same conclusively.<br><br>

                8.19 Risks:<br>

                I hereby acknowledge that I am availing the Payment Instruction Services at my own risk.<br><br>

                8.20 Misuse of Cust id and IPIN:<br>

                I acknowledge that if any third person obtains access to my Cust id and IPIN, such third person would be
                able to provide Payment Instructions / other instructions to the Bank. I shall ensure that the Terms and
                Conditions applicable to the use of the Cust id and IPIN as contained herein are complied with at all
                times.<br><br>

                Internet Frauds:<br>
                The Internet per se is susceptible to a number of frauds, misuse, hacking and other actions that could
                affect Payment Instructions / other instructions to the Bank. Whilst the Bank shall aim to provide
                security to prevent the same, there cannot be any guarantee from such Internet frauds, hacking and other
                actions that could affect Payment Instructions / other instructions to the Bank including result in
                delay or failure in processing the instructions. I shall separately evolve/ evaluate all risks arising
                out of the same and the Bank shall not be responsible for the same.
                I understand that doing a Net Banking transaction at a Cybercafe/shared computer terminal is risky and I
                shall not use the services of a cybercafe/shared computer terminal to do any Net Banking transactions.<br><br>

                Mistakes and Errors:<br>

                The filling in of applicable data for transfer of funds and/or issue of Demand Drafts would require
                proper, accurate and complete details.<br><br>

                For instance, I am aware that:<br>

                I would be required to fill in the correct account number of the person to whom the funds are to be
                transferred;<br>
                I would be required to fill in the correct Credit Card number while making Credit Card payments;
                I would be required to fill in the correct details such as the name of the payee (who may or may not
                have an account with the Bank), mailing address, amount of the Demand Draft and the city/state where the
                Demand Draft is payable.<br><br>

                In the event of any inaccuracy in this regard, the funds could be transferred to incorrect accounts or
                the Demand Draft maybe incorrectly issued or sent to a wrong address and there is no guarantee of
                recovery of the same thereafter. I shall therefore take all care to ensure that there are no mistakes
                and errors and that the information given by me to the Bank in this regard is error free, accurate,
                proper and complete at all points of time. I indemnify the Bank from any loss due to an error on my
                part.<br><br>

                On the other hand in the event of my account receiving an incorrect credit by reason of a mistake
                committed by some other person, the Bank shall be entitled to reverse the incorrect credit at any time
                whatsoever without my consent. I shall be liable and responsible to the Bank and accede to accept the
                Bank's instructions without questions for any unfair or unjust gain obtained by me as a result of the
                same.<br><br>

                Transactions:<br>

                The transactions, which may require, the transfer of the funds or issue of Demand Draft may not fructify
                or may not be completed by the parties to whom I request the Bank to transfer the funds or issue of
                Demand Draft. The Bank is not in any manner involved in the said transactions and contracts and my sole
                recourse in this regard shall be with the party with whom I have the transactions. The Bank is merely
                providing me services whereby the said funds would be transferred on my instructions.<br><br>

                Technology Risks:<br>

                The technology for enabling the transfer of funds and the other services offered by the Bank could be
                affected by virus or other malicious, destructive or corrupting code, programme or macro. It may also be
                possible that the site of the Bank may require maintenance and during such time it may not be possible
                to process the request of the customers. This could result in delays in the processing of instructions
                or failure in the processing of instructions. I understand that the Bank disclaims all and any
                liability, whether direct or indirect, whether arising out of loss or profit or otherwise arising out of
                any failure or inability by the Bank to honour any customer instruction for whatsoever reason.<br><br>

                8.21 Limits:<br>

                I am aware that the Bank may from time to time impose maximum and minimum limits including daily limits
                on transfer of funds that may be transferred or amount of the Demand Draft that can be issued by virtue
                of the payment instructions given hereunder. I acknowledge that the same is to reduce the risks on me.
                For instance, the Bank may impose transaction restrictions within particular periods or amount
                restrictions within a particular period or even each transaction limits. I shall be bound by such limits
                imposed and shall strictly comply with them. The Bank shall put an appropriate message on the concerned
                page or the website.<br><br>

                8.22 Indemnity:<br>

                I shall not be liable for any unauthorized transactions occurring through the use of Net Banking, which
                can be attributed to the fraudulent or negligent conduct of the employees of the Bank.<br><br>

                unauthorized transactions occurring in the Net Banking accounts after the receipt of such advice by the

                8.25.4 I agree that the registration for the said Service is possible only through NetBanking and there
                are no other avenues for registration of the same. I can only register for this service by logging on to
                NetBanking with his login credentials.<br><br>

                8.25.5 I agree that the details entered at the time of registration is known only to me and no one else
                is privy to that data. I agree that I should not share this with anyone nor write it down.<br><br>

                8.25.6 I understand that there could be instances beyond the control of the Bank and the on line
                registration process remains incomplete. In such cases, I have to restart the online registration and
                complete the same. The Bank shall not be liable for any claims, damages arising out of the incomplete
                online registration.<br><br>

                appropriate mediums.<br><br>

                8.25.9 I agree that in case of wrong validation the Bank reserves the right to disable the Third Party
                Transfer facilities. In such case, I will have to once again apply for TPT facilities by filling up a
                form and submitting the same at a branch.<br><br>

                8.25.10 I understand that there are four parts to registration for Secure Banking Service which are

                change of registered number.<br><br>

                8.25.12 I understand that the Bank may ask questions to its customer before the completion of a
                transaction as additional verification checks. I need to input the answers to those questions which I
                have given at the time of registration. I agree that, in case of wrong entry of the answers for the
                questions asked, the Bank may at its discretion dis-continue with the transaction.<br><br>

                that this will be done only from view of customer convenience and Bank is not liable in case password
                has been compromised. It is recommended that I need to get my PCs/laptops scanned on a regular basis and
